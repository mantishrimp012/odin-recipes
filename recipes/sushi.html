    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi was known to have originated in Japan and traditionally consists of vinegared rice seasoned with sugar or salt
        with a filling that can contain fish, vegetables, fruit and is usually enclosed with sheets of seaweed called "nori sheets". Nowadays,
         there are many types of sushi available for consumption after experimentation with different fillings and toppings. The
         range of sushi types available today centre around the common principles of the usage of ingredients including fish, nori, seasoned rice 
         and vegetables. One of the very popular types of sushi that is much-loved by many in Japan as well as around the world, is shrimp 
         tempura sushi rolls. The crux of this type of sushi when compared to other types is that it utilises fried shrimp tempura to create its 
         world-class flavour. The flavour is further enhanced with its vegetable filling and toppings, with avocado or cucumber usually used 
         as its vegetable filling.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    For the sushi rice:
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>

    For the sushi rolls:
    <ul>
        <li>Bamboo sushi mat</li>
        <li>4 sheets of nori</li>
        <li>8 pre-cooked tempura shrimp</li>
        <li>8 strips of cucumber</li>
        <li>8 slices of avocado</li>
        <li>3 tbsp black and/or white sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the rice into a colander and rinse until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and 2 cups of water into a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil uncovered. 
            Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove the pot from 
            the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, salt and sesame seeds in a small bowl and heat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. 
            Transfer the rice to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Fold thoroughly to combine. Allow rice 
            to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Lay out bamboo sushi mat and place one nori sheet on a flat surface and press approximately 1/3 to 1/2 
            cup of rice across the surface of the nori, going all the way to the edges, except for the side furthest 
            to you; leave a 1-2 cm gap containing no rice. This will be side used to seal the sushi rolls. This process 
            can be done with a spoon or dampened fingers.</li>
        <li>Place 2 shrimp, 2 strips of cucumber and 2 slices of avocado along the centre of the sushi rice.</li>
        <li>Wet the empty edge of the nori sheet with your fingers, then pick up the edge of the rolling mat closest 
            to you and tightly roll up the sushi.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi then serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry dish thought to have originated in France, and is now
        enjoyed by many all around the world. The name of the dish was given due to its crescent shape,
         which was inspired by the Austrian dish <em>kipferl</em>, however its recipe is largely based on
         the usage of the French yeast-fermented laminated dough. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The croissant can include different fillings in order to accentuate or differentiate the taste, and 
        these can include chocolate, or fruit jelly. This recipe will focus on creating croissants that
        harbour a chocolate filling, hence the title of the recipe; chocolate croissants.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups flour (500g)</li>
        <li>0.5 cup water (120ml)</li>
        <li>0.5 cup milk (120ml)</li>
        <li>0.25 cup sugar (50g)</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 packet instant dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1.25 cups cold unsalted butter (285g), cut into o.5 inch (1cm) thick slices</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 bars sweetened chooclate bar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour, water, milk, sugar, salt, yeast, and butter in a large bowl. This will be the foundation for the dough.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixture out onto a clean counter once it starts to clump and lightly knead the dough and form it into a ball, making sure to prevent over-kneading it.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Slice the cold butter in thirds and place it onto a sheet of parchment paper, then place another piece of parchment on top of the butter, and beat it with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Keeping the parchment paper on the butter, use a rolling pin to roll the butter into a 7-inch (18 cm) square, ½-inch (1 cm) thick. If necessary, use a knife to trim the edges and place the trimmings back on top of the butter and continue to roll into a square. Transfer to the refrigerator once done.</li>
        <li>To roll out the dough, lightly flour the counter. Place the dough on the counter, and push the rolling pin once vertically into the dough and once horizontally to form four quadrants.</li>
        <li>Roll out each corner and form a 10-inch (25cm) square.</ls>
        <li>Place the butter layer on top of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter, enclosing it completely. Roll the dough with a rolling pin to seal the seams, making sure to lengthen the dough, rather than widening it.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Once refrigerated, roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s 8x24 inches (20x61 cm). Fold the top half down to the middle, and brush off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom half over the top and turn the dough clockwise to the left. This completes the first turn. Cover and refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough again two more times, completing three turns in total and refrigerating for 1 hour in between each turn. If at anytime the dough or butter begins to soften, stop and transfer back to the fridge. After the final turn, cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>To form the croissants, cut the dough in half. Place one half in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Flour the surface and roll out the dough into a long narrow strip, about 8x40 inches (20x101 cm).
            With a knife, trim the edges of the dough.
            Cut the dough into 4 rectangles.</li>
        </li>Place the chocolate on the edge of the dough and roll tightly enclosing it in the dough.
        Place the croissants on a baking sheet, seam side down.</li>
        <li>Repeat these steps with the other half of the dough.</li>
        <li>Brush the croissants with the beaten egg. Save the rest of the egg wash in the fridge for later.
            Place the croissants in a warm place to rise for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Once the croissants have proofed, brush them with one more layer of egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
